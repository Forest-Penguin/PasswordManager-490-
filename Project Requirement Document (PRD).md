# Project Requirement Document (PRD) 

## Objective

This PRD details the architecture, technical requirements, and roadmap for the development of the **Local Password Manager and Generator** application. It serves as the foundation for aligning the development team on functionality, security, and user experience expectations. The document will be used to guide implementation, testing, and deployment while serving as a living reference that evolves with the project’s lifecycle.

## 1. Overview

The **Local Password Manager and Generator** app is a secure, local-only tool designed to manage and generate strong passwords for users. It emphasizes privacy by eliminating the need for cloud-based storage, ensuring all sensitive data remains encrypted on the user's device. The app will use cutting-edge encryption standards and offer a variety of user-friendly features such as password strength analysis, compromised password detection, and customizable password generation.

This document defines the feature set, technical specifications, and deployment strategy for the project, acting as both a roadmap and quality benchmark.

## 2. Feature Categories

### 2.1 Core Features (MVP Functionality)

- **Secure User Authentication via USB and Master Password**:
  - Users authenticate by inserting a USB device containing an encrypted master key and entering their master password. The system verifies the combination, leveraging multi-factor authentication (MFA) via hardware (USB) and password entry.
- **Password Management (CRUD Operations)**:
  - Users can securely create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) passwords stored locally in a fully encrypted database.
- **Advanced Password Generator**:
  - A password generator that allows users to define parameters (e.g., length, special characters, upper/lower case, etc.) to create highly secure passwords.
- **Password Breach Detection**:
  - Integration with the **Have I Been Pwned** API to check if any stored passwords have been compromised in known data breaches.
- **AES-256 Encryption & Bcrypt Hashing**:
  - Passwords are encrypted using AES-256, a highly secure encryption standard, while the master password is hashed using bcrypt, offering resistance against brute-force attacks.

### 2.2 Desired Features (Enhanced Usability)

- **Theme Customization (Dark/Light Mode)**:
  - Users can toggle between dark and light UI themes to match personal preference or environmental conditions.
- **Password Strength Indicator**:
  - Real-time analysis and feedback on password strength, encouraging users to generate stronger passwords.
- **Search Functionality**:
  - A search feature that allows users to easily locate stored passwords by filtering based on service names or metadata.
- **Encrypted Import/Export**:
  - Users can export their encrypted password database to a file for backup and import passwords from external sources, ensuring data portability.

### 2.3 Aspirational Features (High-Value Additions)

- **Biometric Authentication**:
  - Support for biometric login (fingerprint, facial recognition) in addition to USB and password authentication, offering added convenience without compromising security.
- **Multi-Device Synchronization**:
  - Secure synchronization of password data across multiple devices using end-to-end encryption. Cloud services can be optionally integrated but will not store plaintext passwords.
- **Secure Password Sharing**:
  - The ability to share selected passwords securely with trusted contacts through encrypted communication channels.
- **Offline Mode**:
  - Ensure full functionality without requiring an internet connection, allowing users to access stored passwords and generate new ones even when offline.

## 3. Task Breakdown & Assignments

Each aspect of the project is broken down into specialized tasks, assigned to specific developers to streamline the development process:

| Task                           | Assigned To | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend Development (UI/UX)    | Developer 1 | Build the user interface using Electron.js. Includes creating the login view, password manager, and generator views. |
| Backend Development (Encryption) | Developer 2 | Handle password encryption, storage, and security protocols using Python and cryptographic libraries. |
| USB Authentication Module       | Developer 3 | Implement USB-based authentication using PyUSB and integrate cryptographic decryption mechanisms. |
| API Integration (Password Breach) | Developer 4 | Develop integration with the **Have I Been Pwned** API for breach detection and reporting.     |
| Password Generation Logic       | Developer 5 | Implement customizable password generation logic, including validation for strength and randomness. |

### 3.1 Quality Assurance

- **Test Automation**: Each developer is responsible for writing unit tests to cover their modules. Automated testing pipelines will be set up to ensure continuous integration and verification of all features.
- **Security Audits**: Periodic internal security audits will be conducted on the encryption, authentication, and data management systems.

## 4. System Design

### 4.1 Modular Architecture

The app will follow a modular architecture, ensuring each core component (authentication, encryption, password management) operates independently, promoting maintainability and scalability.

- **Authentication Module**: Handles login via USB and master password.
- **Password Management Module**: CRUD operations for password storage.
- **Encryption/Decryption Module**: Implements AES-256 for password encryption and bcrypt for hashing master passwords.
- **Password Generation Module**: Generates strong passwords based on user preferences.
- **API Module**: Communicates with the Have I Been Pwned API for breach detection.



### 4.2 User Interface Views

- **Login View**: Displays USB detection status, password input field, and login button.
- **Password Manager**: Lists all stored passwords, with options to view, copy, delete, or check if compromised.
- **Password Generator**: Allows customization of password length, character types, and displays a strength meter.
- **Settings View**: Allows users to toggle between light/dark mode, enable biometric login, and configure import/export preferences.

## 5. Database Design

The local database uses **SQLite** to store encrypted password data. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256.

### Schema

- **Users Table**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `username` (Text)
  - `master_password_hash` (Text)
  
- **Passwords Table**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key, references Users Table)
  - `service` (Text) – the associated website or app
  - `encrypted_password` (Text)
  - `is_compromised` (Boolean)

## 6. Development & Deployment

### 6.1 Development Environment

Each developer will use their local machine for development, running a stack that includes:

- **Electron.js** for the frontend.
- **Python** with required cryptographic libraries (PyCryptodome, PyUSB).
- **Docker** containers or virtual environments to ensure consistency across development setups.

### 6.2 Deployment Strategy

- The app will be bundled as a desktop application using **Electron's** cross-platform packaging tools for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Automated scripts will be used to handle versioning and package generation.
  
### 6.3 Testing and Continuous Integration

- **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** will be used to implement a CI/CD pipeline that runs tests, builds the app, and deploys it to test environments.
  
## 7. Goals and Success Criteria

### 7.1 Usability Goals

- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, providing clear feedback on password strength and security.
- Performance benchmarks should include instant login (<1 second) and minimal delay for password generation (<500ms).

### 7.2 Security Goals

- All sensitive data must remain encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- No plaintext passwords or sensitive information should ever be exposed in logs or memory dumps.

## 8. Development Roadmap

This document will evolve with the project. Key milestones and sprints will include:

- **Sprint 1**: Basic UI and USB authentication.
- **Sprint 2**: CRUD functionality for password management.
- **Sprint 3**: Encryption and breach detection.
- **Sprint 4**: Full feature testing, bug fixing, and security audits.
